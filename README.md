# KodaBot

1. `assign_bot` and `assign_bot_scheduler` are running instances of KodaBot which more or less work. `assign_bot` handles webhooks from GH, while `assign_bot_scheduler` handles the scheduled tasks. `assign_bot_scheduler` runs every 20 minutes and check the state of assigned issues
2. `analytics_bot` currently doesn't run by itself and is just a script that can be run manually. It's initial purpose was to run automatically, but right now, take JSON files generated by `kodadot_hacks` and open up PR with it.
