# KodaBot

1. Every folder in autocode runs as a separate instance in autocode (folder structure is preserved) 
2. `assign_bot` and `assign_bot_scheduler` are running instances of KodaBot which more or less work. `assign_bot` handles webhooks from GH, while `assign_bot_scheduler` handles the scheduled tasks. `assign_bot_scheduler` runs every 20 minutes and check the state of assigned issues
3. `analytics_bot` currently doesn't run by itself and is just script that can be run manually. It's initial purpose was to run automatically, but right now, it takes JSON files generated by `kodadot_hacks` (uploaded to cloudflare) and opens up PR with it. 
4. `python hacks` can be used to generate json leaderboard and burn rate files. Scripts are ordered (not tied together yet, needs to be run in order). tokens for SUBSCAN and GH are missing.
